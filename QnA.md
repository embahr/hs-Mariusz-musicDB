Describe in a high level the solution you have in mind
> A users database will store user data (names, who they follow, and music they have listened to). A basic general Collaborative Filtering style method will be used to recommend music the user hasn’t heard yet, based on the tags, and music listened to by people they follow.

What other data could you use to improve recommendations?
> - Amount of plays for a specific song
-  a like/dislike system
- whether or not a song has been added to a playlist
- whether or not a song has been skipped many times vs. plays
- song tempo/mood

Assume a more real world situation where you could have more data you described above, and more time to implement, could you think of a possibly more efficient way to recommend?
> Songs disliked by followers wouldn’t be recommended. If a song is often skipped after being played, it would be less likely to be recommended. A low tempo song in the same genre would be less likely to be recommended if a user only listens to faster music in that genre. 

Assume you have more than one implementation of recommendations, how could you test which one is more effective using data generated by user actions?
> I would check if a recommendation led to a play of the song, if the song was liked/disliked or skipped.
